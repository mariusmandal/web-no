            <h3>EARLY YEARS <small>#building</small></h3>
            <p>I've loved building things ever
                since my dad gave me my first hammer â€” at the age of three, to my mother's bafflement.
                Dad built furniture, and in search of my own thing, I quickly fell in love with building websites
                and applications at the age of 11.
            </p>

            <p>
                My first job was as a gardener at the local bank (I was 10), before I moved on to greater
                adventures in the service industry (my brother's furniture store, the local corner store, and an
                electronics store in the big city). At the age of 18 I'd already sold my first websites, and joined
                my cousin's
                start up <a href="https://smartmedia.no/">Smart Media</a>.
            </p>

            <h3>2003: GAMING <small>#php #mysql</small></h3>

            <p>
                Gaming was different when I was 16, so me and my friends arranged LAN parties in the local
                community. To speed up check-ins (we had 100+ participants for the bigger ones), I utilized
                an outdated barcode scanner from the furniture store. Hooking it up to the seat reservation
                system I'd built wasn't too hard, so I also made a small cashier software while at it.
                This way we could sell our pizzas and sodas more efficiently, ultimately spending more time gaming.
            </p>

            <h3>2006: FIRST STARTUP <small>#cms #product</small></h3>
            <p>
                At <a href="https://smartmedia.no/" target="_blank">Smart Media</a> I worked as lead developer,
                building a CMS (didn't we all in the early 2000s?), and various systems on top of
                this â€” everything from ticket systems, exercise journals, ad rolls and time tracking. While I
                enjoyed building, the client meetings
                and project specifications sparked my life-long interest for product management and solving the
                user's actual needs.

            <div class="indent">
                <h4>âŒ¥ &nbsp; RESCUEME.io <small>#mobile</small></h4>
                <p>As a side project, me and two friends made <a href="https://rescueme.io">rescueme.io</a>,
                    a microservice that has helped locate and save several people's lives for the better part of a
                    decade.
                    While waiting for the standardized AML service, our service utilize phone location features to help
                    the local Red Cross with SAR (search and rescue).
                    Used by both the Norwegian police, Red Cross, and health care services,
                    it's even been deployed in the occasional Nordic SAR mission.

            <p>
                At the national administration of the <a href="https://ukm.no/" target="_blank">Norwegian Youth
                Festivals of
                Art (UKM)</a>, I gained my 10+ years of <a href="https://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a>
                experience. Building and running a system to manage 400 yearly festival's sign ups, scheduling and
                communications platforms with a team of 2 is indeed a full time job. But boy did we have a lot of
                fun!
            </p>

            <p>
                Despite trying hard, I still haven't found a way to compact 13yrs to one paragraph, so
                I'm currently working on a separate UKM chapter! Teasers:

                <p>Spring of 2016 I took some time off to be the <a href="https://megacool.co">first ever Megacool
                    Intern</a> (no t-shirt, unfortunately).
                    Joining up with the team in San Francisco to play around with their platform, I built a kiosk
                    solution showing game clipping highlights. That poor Mac Mini ran for 3yrs straight, showing gifs all day
                    long after I left.

            <p>
                MORE TO COME
            </p>

            <h3>2021: MEDAL.tv
                <small>#java #postgres #db-replication #telemetry #python #remote-teams #engineering-manager</small></h3>
            <p>
                At Medal I fell in love with Java, a language I'd barely used before. Starting as a Backend Engineer,
                I was quickly recognized as Senior, before taking over as the Engineering Manager.
                I'll admit being both starstruck and feeling humble when my first assignment was to create endpoints
                for Microsoft's Xbox team.
            </p>
            <p>
                I managed the Discovery, Social & Monetization teams (not all at once), and worked
                alongside some insanely talented people. Team meetings meant someone just woke up, and others were
                heading to bed, as my teams were distributed from India to the Pacific Coast â€” requiring a toolset of
                its own.
            </p>
            <p>Pushing to prod meant checking <a href="https://honeycomb.io">Honeycomb</a> for instant performance
                updates, and now I can't for the life  of me imagine running a platform without telemetry like that.
                The huge datasets we worked on required
                upping my SQL game, and I still marvel at the performance of my record long SQL query (165 lines).
            </p>

            <h3>2023: STYREPLAN.no <small>#iso-27001 #generics</small></h3>
            <p>
                Returning home I was invited to join the team of <a href="https://styreplan.no">Styreplan</a>, where I
                went back to coding Java while I re-gained my work-life balance. Mastering Generics I unlocked a
                new level of love for Java and strict typing.

            <h3>2024: UNLOC.app <small>#typescript #react #firestore</small></h3>
            <p>
                When offered to join Unloc, the temptation of returning to the startup scene and the
                working with actual hardware was too big. The mission of digitizing access resonates well with my
                wish to create software easing peoples everyday lives. Which led to me embarking on my next adventure.
            </p>
            <p>
                At Unloc I've been able to put my fascination for telemetry to work, uncovering valuable insights, and
                improving our over-all service. I may seem like a broken record when I ask for "telemetry", "data"
                or "monitoring", but my coworkers all appreciate it.

            <p>As a full-stack engineer, I've finally gotten properly acquainted with React, although I'll admit I
                prefer to present my data in a structured manner through an api.</p>
